*Benchmarking generalized Stream-Processing workloads*

This repo holds documentation and code for my senior thesis project: creating a generalized benchmarking framework for stream processing workloads. This project is still in heavy construction and much of it is unusable without knowing how the framework functions.

See the [wiki ](https://github.com/srujun/stream-bench/wiki) for more information.
